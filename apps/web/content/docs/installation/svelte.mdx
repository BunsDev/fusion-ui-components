<Steps>

### Information

This project and all components are written in **TypeScript**. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.

### Create project

```bash
npx @svelte-add/tailwindcss@latest
```

### Prerequisites

These are the main dependencies you will need to get started.

```bash
pnpm add svelte-inview
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

```ts {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```


### Run the CLI

Run the `nyxbui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx nyxbui@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no / yes
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › src/index.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › ~/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › ~/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no / yes (no)
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx nyxbui@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
